# What is it? 
Project created for the Physics Course. The idea of the project is to simulate elastic collisions between two spheres in two-dimensional space.

## :rocket: Features
1. Changing all parameters of the sphere:
  * Mass
  * Horizontal and Vertical Speed
  * Size 

2. Both spheres can move around the canvas using drag and drop

3. Turn off and on the drawing of the velocity vector of each sphere

4. Zoom in and out the camera

5. Pause and resume the simulation without restarting


## :round_pushpin: Requirements
* Unity 2019.3.13f1 or above
* .NET 4.5
* C# 7

## :package: Installation
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/evlko/PhysicsSphere2D
```   

## :hammer: How to use it
Clone the project and install Unity. Run the project and open the main scene to simulate.

## :bulb: Possible Improvements
1. Adding and removing new spheres
2. Writing new collision logic, since currently only one object can be a push
